                <p> I am proficient in problem-solving and troubleshooting code. I am most interested in game development and web development as I consider these two concepts to be a form of art that entertains and makes life convenient for other people. I find web development interesting because it focuses more on creativity and is less demanding in terms of analysis and problem-solving. Web development will allow me to strengthen my programming skills along with my creativity putting me one step closer to being a Game Developer.</p>
